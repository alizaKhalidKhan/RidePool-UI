# RidePool-UI
Hello Everyone! I recently designed a UI for a **RidePool** app as part of an assignment from our teacher, Ms. Kanwal. The app allows users to share rides with both familiar and unfamiliar individuals, and it includes a feature for pre-booking rides by selecting the date, time, and pickup location. This UI was created to address common commuting issues, such as overcrowded public transportation, traffic congestion, and the lack of available cars on ride-sharing apps during rush hours.
